Package gatt provides a Bluetooth Low Energy gatt implementation in Go.

Gatt (Generic Attribute Profile) is the protocol used to write BLE peripherals (servers) and centrals (clients).

Gatt is not ready for production use. The API is subject to change.

gatt is similar to [bleno](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno) and [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble), which offer BLE GATT implementations for node.js.

Please see [godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/paypal/gatt) for documentation.

Gatt is released under a [BSD-style license](./LICENSE.md).
